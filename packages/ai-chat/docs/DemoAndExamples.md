## Demo

You can see a [demo of the Carbon AI Chat](../../demo/index.html) and view the [source code of the demo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/demo).

The demo showcases the full featured chat interface with most available customization options and response types.

## Examples

### React Examples

The [React examples](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/examples/react) demonstrate various integration patterns and features, including basic integration, watsonx.ai streaming, custom elements, history loading, and other features.

### Web Component Examples

The [web component examples](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/examples/web-components) mirror the React examples but use Lit-based web components. These include basic integration, watsonx.ai streaming, custom element patterns, history loading, and more.

All web component examples follow the same patterns as React but use native web component APIs and Lit for templating.
