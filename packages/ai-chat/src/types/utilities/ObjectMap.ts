 * This interface represents an object which behaves like a map. The object contains a set of properties representing
 * keys in the map and the values of those properties are all of the same type (TPropertyType). The type of the keys
 * defaults to any string but you can specify a type that is a string enum instead if you want a map that contains
 * only keys for a given enum (or other similar type).
