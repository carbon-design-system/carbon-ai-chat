/* The carbon tiles currently use the layer-01 token for the background color of the tiles. These layer tokens don't
work with chat because they produce different colors between white and g10, as well as between g90 and g100. For
now create a token whose color that will be consistent for both light themes (based off the g10 color), and also
consistent for both dark themes (based off the g100 color). In the future carbon should create and use a new token
for this background, that works with chat, and we can remove this override. */
