/**
 * This component holds several aria live-regions that are used to make screen reader announcements by the application.
 * This component can announce both plain text as well as the content of complex HTML elements. HTML elements will be
 * converted to a raw text format before being announced.
 *
 * The component makes use of two live-region elements that are permanently attached to the DOM. It will alternate
 * between the usage of these two elements to announce changes. This accomplishes a few things. First, in my initial
 * work, I kept finding cases where the browser would re-read the entire live region when elements are added to it even
 * with aria-relevant="additions" and aria-atomic="false". Clearing the previous content was the only way to stop that
 * happening. However you can't simply add the content and then immediately clear it because sometimes the SR won't read
 * the content without some sort of delay before it's cleared (even waiting a tick isn't enough). In addition, a second
 * element will make sure the SR will read a new message even if it has the same content as a previous message.
