## Getting started

To install `@carbon/ai-chat-components` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install --save @carbon/ai-chat-components
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/ai-chat-components
```

### Basic usage

Our example at [Stackblitz](#tbd) shows the most basic usage:

The first thing you need is **setting up a module bundler** to resolve ECMAScript `import`s. The above example uses [Vite JS](https://vite.dev/), but you can use other bundlers like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) too.

Once you set up a module bundler, you can start importing our component modules, for example:

```javascript
import '@carbon/ai-chat-components/es/components/tile-container/tile-container.js';
```

Once you've imported the component modules, you can use our components in the same manner as native HTML tags, for example:

```html
<cds-aichat-tile-container>
  <cds-tile>
    <h5 class="heading-01 margin-bottom-04">
      AI Chat Tile styling wrapper
    </h5>
    <p class="body-01">
      The Carbon Design System provides a comprehensive library of
      components, tokens, and guidelines. We need to implement the new AI
      Chat component following Carbon's design principles and accessibility
      standards.
    </p>
  </cds-tile>
</cds-aichat-tile-container>
```

### JavaScript framework integration

This package can also be used within other JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and
Vue. This is achievable since web components are the modern browser standard, and
work well with other front-end frameworks that exist in the application. In
turn, this also comes with the benefits of encapsulation within the Shadow DOM.
