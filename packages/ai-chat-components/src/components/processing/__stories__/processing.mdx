# AI Chat Processing

The `cds-aichat-processing` element is used to indicate that data is currently being processed/loaded and the user should wait..

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import "@carbon/ai-chat-components/es/components/processing/index.js";
```

We provide a lit-react wrapper for this web component to consume in a react application and can be imported as below

```javascript
import Processing from "@carbon/ai-chat-components/es/react/processing.js";
```

<Markdown>{`${cdnJs(["processing"])}`}</Markdown>
<Markdown>{`${cdnCss()}`}</Markdown>

### HTML

Wrap any carbon `tile`, `clickable-tile` with `cds-aichat-processing` to get the styles.
The div containing the `cds-aichat-processing-footer` will have all the footer styles with an additional class `vertical` to change the buttons to stack.

```html
<cds-aichat-processing>
  <cds-tile>
    <h5 class="heading-01 margin-bottom-04">
      AI Chat Tile styling wrapper
    </h5>
    <p class="body-01">
      The Carbon Design System provides a comprehensive library of
      components, tokens, and guidelines. We need to implement the new AI
      Chat component following Carbon's design principles and accessibility
      standards.
    </p>
  </cds-tile>
</cds-aichat-processing>
```
