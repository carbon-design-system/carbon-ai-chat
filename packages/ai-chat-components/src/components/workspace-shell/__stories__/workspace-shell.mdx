# AI Chat Workspace shell


## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import "@carbon/ai-chat-components/es/components/workspace-shell/index.js";
```

<Markdown>{`${cdnJs({ components: ["workspace-shell"] })}`}</Markdown>
<Markdown>{`${cdnCss()}`}</Markdown>

### Slots and Composition

The **`<cds-aichat-workspace-shell>`** component defines five dedicated slots that structure the overall workspace layout:

| Slot Name | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `toolbar` | Represents the toolbar area of the workspace. |
| `header` | Represents the header section, containing title, subtitle and actions. |
| `notification` | Area for displaying workspace notifications. |
| `body` | The main content area of the workspace. |
| `footer` | Represents the footer section, usually containing action buttons. |

Each of these slots can accept **any element or component**, allowing users to freely construct and customize the workspace layout as needed.  
Alternatively, adopters can use the **provided subcomponents**, which are designed specifically for each section. These subcomponents offer consistent styling and default behaviors that align with the AI Chat Workspace design patterns.


| Section | Subcomponent |
|----------|---------------|
| Toolbar | `<cds-aichat-workspace-shell-toolbar>` |
| Header | `<cds-aichat-workspace-shell-header>` |
| Body | `<cds-aichat-workspace-shell-body>` |
| Notification | `<cds-aichat-workspace-shell-notification>` |
| Footer | `<cds-aichat-workspace-shell-footer>` |

Using these subcomponents ensures visual consistency and predictable structure while still giving you the flexibility to build a fully customized workspace experience.
