# AI Chat Workspace shell

The `cds-aichat-workspace-shell` wraps the Carbon Design System's [Tile](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-tile--overview) component to apply AI Chat styles.
if using a footer, `cds-aichat-workspace-shell-footer` class name needs to be added to the footer element, with an additional class vertical to get the vertical button layout.

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import "@carbon/ai-chat-components/es/components/workspace-shell/index.js";
```

We provide a lit-react wrapper for this web component to consume in a react application and can be imported as below

```javascript
import TileContainer from "@carbon/ai-chat-components/es/react/workspace-shell.js";
```

<Markdown>{`${cdnJs({ components: ["workspace-shell"] })}`}</Markdown>
<Markdown>{`${cdnCss()}`}</Markdown>

### HTML

Wrap any carbon `tile`, `clickable-tile` with `cds-aichat-workspace-shell` to get the styles.
The div containing the `cds-aichat-workspace-shell-footer` will have all the footer styles with an additional class `vertical` to change the buttons to stack.

```html
<cds-aichat-workspace-shell>
  <cds-tile>
    <h5 class="heading-01 margin-bottom-04">
      AI Chat Tile styling wrapper
    </h5>
    <p class="body-01">
      The Carbon Design System provides a comprehensive library of
      components, tokens, and guidelines. We need to implement the new AI
      Chat component following Carbon's design principles and accessibility
      standards.
    </p>
  </cds-tile>
</cds-aichat-workspace-shell>
```
