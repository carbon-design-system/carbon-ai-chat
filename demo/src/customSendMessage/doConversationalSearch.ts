Carbon forms the backbone of organic chemistry due to its ability to form four covalent bonds and create long chains and complex structures. The element has an atomic number of 6 and is located in group 14 of the periodic table.

Carbon nanotubes, another important allotrope, exhibit remarkable mechanical and electrical properties. These cylindrical structures were first discovered in 1991 and have applications in electronics, materials science, and nanotechnology.

Isotopes of carbon include carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14. Carbon-14 is radioactive and is used in carbon dating to determine the age of organic materials up to about 50,000 years old.`,
